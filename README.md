# IEOR171_Project2
Our IEOR 171 Project 2, Instattend, focuses on the creation of a BETTER attendance taking device than what is currently offered in the marketplace. We take a social aspect of participation, using Instagram, and use it to account for students in the classroom. Or to put it simply, "making taking attendance fun again"
